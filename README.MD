### Christine's Cross Country Road Trip -  Foursquare Check-In Statistics

I went on a cross country road trip from December 5, 2012 - January 13th, 2013, and along the way I checked into locations on Foursquare. I decided to grab a JSON dataset of my checkins from the [Foursquare API Explorer](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/explore#req=users/self) and parse it to display statistics of my trip.
